                        Over the past two years or so, I’ve received so many emails from you guys, asking questions about how I opened my bakery, what the process was like, etc. Back in the beginning of 2016, I wrote a post on what I learned after opening a bakery (read it here) but I didn’t really go into enough detail for some of you regarding what you need to know before and during the process of opening a bakery, which left you asking so many more questions. So I thought it was about time to sit down and tell you what you need to know!
                        <br>
                        Something important to remember is that this post is written from my personal experience, and the process that I went through may not be the exact one you’ll go through (or that you’ve already been through) – every city, every landlord, every business is different! Hopefully this helps answer some of the questions you’ve been asking! I love hearing from you, so please feel free to share your experiences and ask any questions below.

                        I get asked all the time how I came up with branding for my company. The truth is, I feel that I am the worst person to ever give advice on this topic because I just honestly and truly did what I loved – baked feminine, sprinkly things and designed my shop, website, packaging (boxes, ribbons, bags) and business cards in the same fashion. For the menu, lots of sprinkles, cutesy cookies, feminine cakes and macarons in pastel hues – it all just flowed naturally. I also had a clear vision of what I didn’t want to do (super-bright colours, typical holiday colours at Christmas, character cakes of any kind) and steered my brand in a more delicate, sweet and more feminine direction. Initially, some customers were angry when we politely refused making an Elmo cake (and some of that staff I had in the beginning didn’t understand why I wouldn’t make just anything any customer asked for) but most just understood that Sweet Bake Shop isn’t the place to go for that type of thing – it made sense, because it wasn’t my brand. If you don’t feel comfortable developing branding on your own, you can always reach out to someone in marketing to help assist you in developing something that you love.

                        I get this question every single week: How do you know what to charge for your desserts? It’s a bit of a complicated process, but skipping it and just pulling a price out of thin air isn’t the way to go about starting a business. I had my mom (a serious numbers person) look over all of my prices and math before I settled on final prices for each item.

                        Get to know your city, the different neighbourhoods and really have a look at what’s around in those areas. Is the area you’d prefer to open up shop already full of bakeries? Do you think that customers and residents in the area will pay the prices you’re hoping to charge? Choosing an area that has a lot of walk-by traffic is definitely a smart move, as well as an area that is close to public transit or that has ample parking (street, parkade, parking lot, whatever) so that people can easily carry their baked goods to their car.

                        On a surface dusted lightly with powdered sugar, roll out some green fondant very thinly, 1/8″ or so and cut our various size trees. Use a paintbrush or your finger to dampen the back of the trees with water and arrange them on the top of the cookies. Add additional white glaze to the trees and then immediately sprinkle with more white non pareils to make snow capped trees. Let the cookies thoroughly dry (we let ours sit overnight) before stacking or packaging.

                        This is where the majority of your money could end up being spent – equipment is pricey! To keep your costs down, I highly recommend searching for local restaurant supply auctions, where you can pick up gently-used equipment on the cheap. Another option is to rent new equipment with a company like SilverChef, who is a rent-to-buy equipment funding partner – I used them and had a great experience! And of course, if the money is flowing, you can always purchase new equipment from fancy restaurant supply companies, like these guys.

                        Next time I will be going over marketing, hidden cost, staffing and much much more....
