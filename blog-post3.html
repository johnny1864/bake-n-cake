                    <p>
                        I’ve had so many questions about what it’s really like to write a cookbook, how to go about writing one if you’re a first-timer and what my experience was like, so in the spirit of sharing information (you know I love to share), I thought a blog post on the topic would be the perfect way to kick off the new year. Also, I should mention that I’m writing this from my own personal experience and this process may be different for you! So grab a coffee, curl up in your cozies and get comfy!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Typically, finding an agent requires doing a little digging. Many cookbook authors list their agents in the acknowledgments in the back of their books, which is one way to find out the name of an agent you’d like to represent you. Another way is to do a quick search online, which will turn up a few names and emails or phone numbers of literary agents that you can contact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My editor put me in touch with a few agents that she thought would be a great fit for my potential book, I contacted them and after a few phone calls and emails, I had representation. Of course, I didn’t have to use an agent, but let me tell you, having one has been so incredibly helpful! An agent is essentially a direct link between a writer and a potential publisher and can also act as a buffer between you and your editor. For example, if you don’t agree on something that your editor wants, instead of having an argument, you would speak via your agent. So helpful! As for how agents get paid, they take a percentage of your wages earned, usually between 15-20%, which, in my opinion, is so worth it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you choose to have a literary agent represent you, the two of you will work together to create what’s called a proposal. Essentially, it’s an eye-catching, multi-page document that your agent will use to sell your idea for a book to a publisher. In this document, you’ll include your “story” (aka, who you are), a marketing strategy for your book, sample recipes, who your competition is, a table of contents and lots of photos, all done up in a neat little package that a graphic designer has helped put together for you. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you’ve signed a contract with a publisher, you’ll need to get started on recipe testing! Even if you have your recipes down perfectly, you’ll definitely want to make sure that they’re easy to follow and that the ingredients are accessible to home bakers. Also, if you own a bakery and/or are used to baking in mass volume, you’ll need to scale your recipes down to home oven size. For example, a cupcake recipe for 12 or 24 cupcakes is perfect for a cookbook, as opposed to a cupcakes recipe for, say, 96 cupcakes. My editor was a fantastic guide during this process, especially when it came to how many recipes I needed per chapter, so don’t be afraid to ask your editor as many questions as you need to – that’s what she (or he) is there for!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have to be completely transparent here though. As fun as recipes testing was at times, it was also incredibly frustrating. Some of my recipes were ones that I’d loved since the day that they were created, and I felt that they needed little to no adjusting – they were ready to be typed up (yay!). Others, though, I wanted to really perfect, and let me tell you – when you’ve baked a cake 19 times and it still hasn’t turned out the exact way that you’d hoped, it can really make you question your ability to bake anything. How many times I burst into tears in my kitchen during this process was crazy, but I got through it!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’ve never purchased a cookbook without photos (do they exist?!) and my editor and I both felt that the photos in my book needed to mirror my brand and what I had in my Instagram feed, so we made sure to include a photo for every single recipe in my book! Because I shoot all of my own content for my social media and blog posts (unless otherwise credited), it was really important to me to shoot the food photos myself. So I upgraded my camera lens and off I went into the unknown world of food photography, which, let me tell you, was HARD…but I did it! I also asked Kristy of Blush Wedding Photography to come on board and shoot all of the lifestyle photos (ie: me, the kitchen, etc.), which she did beautifully (in only 2 days!). She also helped with the editing of my food photos, which I am forever grateful for! I learned so much about my camera, lighting and about photo editing during this process and even though I struggled through some parts of it, I’m so glad that I was able to shoot my own food photos and I can’t wait for you to see the book!

                        Next time I will be going over marketing, hidden cost, staffing and much much more....
